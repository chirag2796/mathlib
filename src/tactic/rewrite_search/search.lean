# The graph algorithm part of rewrite search

`search.lean` contains the logic to do a graph search. The search algorithm
starts with an equation to prove, treats the left hand side and right hand side as
two vertices in a graph, and uses rewrite rules to find a path that connects the two sides.

An edge represents a proof that can get from one expression to another.
It represents the fact that, starting from the vertex `fr`, the expression in `proof`
can prove the vertex `to`.
`how` contains information that the explainer will use to generate Lean code for the
proof.

/--
A vertex represents an expression that is equivalent to either the left or right side
of our initial equation.
`id` is a numerical id used to refer to this vertex in the context of a single graph.
`exp` is the expression this vertex represents.
`pp` is the string format of the expression; we store this in the vertex to avoid
recalculating it.
`side` is whether this vertex descends from the left or right side of the equation.
`parent` is the edge that originally added this vertex to the graph.

meta structure vertex :=
(id     : ℕ)
(exp    : expr)
(pp     : string)
(side   : side)
(parent : option edge)

/--
The graph represents two trees, one descending from each of the left and right sides
of our initial equation.
`conf` and `rules` determine what rewrites are used to generate new graph vertices.
Here, the format of a rewrite rule is an expression for rewriting, plus a flag for the
direction to apply it in.
`vertices` maps vertex.id to vertex.
`vmap` maps vertex.pp to vertex.id, so we can quickly find collisions.
`solving_edge` represents a solution that will prove our target equation.
It is an edge that would connect the two trees, so `solving_edge.fr` and `solving_edge.to`
are vertices in different trees.

Construct a graph to search for a proof of a given equation.

This graph initially contains only two disconnected vertices corresponding to the two
sides of the equation. When `find_proof` is called, we will run a search and add
new vertices and edges.

Find a list of edges that connect the given edge to the root of its tree.
The edges are returned in leaf-to-root order, while they are in root-to-leaf direction,
so if you want them in the logical order you must reverse the returned list.

Returns two lists that represent a solution. The first list is a path from LHS to some
interior vertex, the second is a path from the RHS to that interior vertex.

Add the new vertex and edge to the graph, that can be proved in one step starting
at a given vertex, with a given rewrite expression.
For efficiency, it's important that this is the only way the graph is mutated,
and it only appends to the end of the `vertices` buffer.

Normally, this is the only external method needed to run the graph search.
